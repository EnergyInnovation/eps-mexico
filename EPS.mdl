		sub-range for the Electricity Sector fuels right now, because All Fuels \
		consolidates solar PV and solar thermal into "solar," onshore wind and \
		offshore wind into "wind," and natural gas nonpeaker and natural gas \
		peaker into "natural gas," and we need a one-to-one correspondance to do \

	~	Here is the purpose for each check in this variable. (1) If the fraction \
		of flexibility points used last year is zero, then we likely are dealing \
		with one of the electricity sources that doesn't require flexibility \
		points, so we shouldn't curtail it. (2) We use a MAX(0) because we cannot \
		allow negative curtailment, and the curtailment function may result in \
		negative numbers for some values of FP usage between 0% and 100%. (3) If \
		the fraction of flexibility points used is between 0% and 100%, we apply \
		the curtailment function directly. However, if the FP use is over 100%, we \
		always allow a minimum amount of dispatch- the amount that would be \
		allowed by the available FP, given by the term 1-ZIDZ(1/fraction of FP \
		used). This is because the curtailment function is typically second- or \
		third-order and would result in unrealistically high curtailment at very \
		high multiples of available FP use if it were uncapped.

		explicitly would be very difficult, as we'd need to account for three \
		possible shifts (petroleum gasoline to biofuel gasoline, petroleum \
		gasoline to electricity, and biofuel gasoline to electricity). In \
		practice, biofuel gasoline is hardly used by plug-in hybrids, and \
		electricity will always be the more economical choice for satisfying an \
		LCFS via generation of carbon-free energy. Therefore, we only allow for \
		one of these three types of shifts in plug-in hybrids: petroleum gasoline \
		to electricity. Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \
		assigned to those vehicles, rather than to plug-in hybrids, later in the \
		calculation steps).

	~	Buildings sector subsidies and rebates are given to energy-supplying cash \
		flow entities in proportion to the share of the modeled region's buildings \
		owned by these entities. Energy-supplying entities likely own buildings in \
		proportion to their total energy production, not just their energy \
		production as used by the buildings sector. But this variable is \
		subscripted by Building Fuel, which would prevent it being used for \
		handling these rebates and subsidies. These rebates and subsidies are \
		extremely minor due to the vanishingly small share of all buildings that \
		are owned by energy-supplying entities, so it is not worth building \
		complex new structure to handle this. Instead, we simply assign the \
		subsidies and rebates to Building Fuels in proportion to the usage of \
		those fuels in buildings. Although this likely significantly \
		under-estimates the share of petroleum in oil-exporting countries, it \
		nonetheless is more than accurate enough for us here, because the \
		subsidies and rebates are tiny, and we mostly simply want to account for \
		them in order to have conservation of cash flows and avoid warnings on the \
		Debugging Assistance sheet.

	~	We use a SMOOTHI function to even out price spikes that unrealistically \
		affect the price of electricity, because the costs of construction of new \
		generation assets really would be spread out over a few years. We use an \
		initial value of zero (and SMOOTHI rather than SMOOTH) because prior to \
		the start of the model run, the change in construction costs due to \
		policies is zero (none were in effect). If we do not, then the first year \
		has a strongly negative change in construction cost that then affects all \
		the prices down the line and pulls them down in an unrealistic way. The \
		curve with an initial value of zero is much closer to the original \
		(unsmoothed) curve than SMOOTH with no initial value.

		elsewhere rather than in this country, or it may be due changes in \
		production levels of existing businesses. These leakage rates were \
		determined via a computer model based on a carbon tax, so leakage can be \
		negative if a foreign firm has a lower carbon intensity than a U.S. firm \
		when producing a particular good (this is the case for natural gas and \
		coal), or if imports to the U.S. are reduced (this is the case for oil).

	~	These equations are complicated because we need to apply an efficiency \
		adjustment when fuels shift between electricity and a non-electricity \
		fuel. We first remove all the fuels that are being shifted (including some \
		that may be staying the same), then we add in all the fuels reallocated to \
		their target fuel types. When the target fuel is electricity, we apply an \
		efficiency adjustment to all of the added fuels, and then we undo the \
		adjustment for electricitiy that was "shifted" to electricity (i.e. stayed \
		the same). When the target fuel is not electricity, we add all of the \
		fuels without an efficiency adjustment, and then we add additional fuel to \
		the target fuel if the source fuel was electricity to make the efficiency \
		adjustment. If you are having trouble understanding these equations, first \
		make sure you understand the simpler examples of fuel shifting code that \
		don't involve electricity efficiency adjustments, which can be found in \
		the calculated variables immediately downstream of the following two input \
		variables: hydgn/RHPF and indst/RIFF.

LDVs Feebate Rate = 0
	~	Dmnl [0,1]
	~	The feebate is set as a fraction of the global best practice feebate rate. \
		The global best practice feebate rate is $2000 per (hundredth gal/mile), \
		which equates to a $2000 fee on an LDV that gets 20 mpg if the pivot point \
		is 25 mpg. (To see this: 20 mpg is 0.04 gpm. 25 mpg is 0.05 gpm. The \
		difference is -.01 gpm. So in order to levy a $2000 fee on the 20 mpg car \
		when the pivot point is 25 mpg, we need a rate of $2000/.01 gpm.) The \
		feebate rate is designated in gpm rather than mpg because this provides \
		the same monetary incentive to save a gallon of fuel for all LDVs, despite \
		their different efficiencies. That is, given a fixed number of miles \
		driven, reducing gpm by 0.01 will save the same quantity of fuel for any \
		car. Given a fixed number of miles driven, increasing mpg by 0.01 will \
		save different amounts of fuel in different cars, depending on their \
		starting efficiencies. We're assuming the pivot point is adjusted to \
		always maintain revenue neutrality (no net cost to government or \
		consumers). This policy lever only applies to passenger LDVs due to a lack \
		of data on feebate effects on other vehicle types. The policy does not \
		increase the efficiency of battery electric LDVs, as it is assumed that \
		they are already sufficiently fuel-efficient to receive any potential \
		benefits of the feebate, so the feebate would not incentivize further fuel \
		efficiency improvements in this type of LDV.

	~	These equations are complicated because we need to apply an efficiency \
		adjustment when fuels shift between electricity and a non-electricity \
		fuel. We first remove all the fuels that are being shifted (including some \
		that may be staying the same), then we add in all the fuels reallocated to \
		their target fuel types. When the target fuel is electricity, we apply an \
		efficiency adjustment to all of the added fuels, and then we undo the \
		adjustment for electricitiy that was "shifted" to electricity (i.e. stayed \
		the same). When the target fuel is not electricity, we add all of the \
		fuels without an efficiency adjustment, and then we add additional fuel to \
		the target fuel if the source fuel was electricity to make the efficiency \
		adjustment. If you are having trouble understanding these equations, first \
		make sure you understand the simpler examples of fuel shifting code that \
		don't involve electricity efficiency adjustments, which can be found in \
		the calculated variables immediately downstream of the following two input \
		variables: hydgn/RHPF and indst/RIFF.

	~	Here is the purpose for each check in this variable. (1) If the fraction \
		of flexibility points used last year is zero, then we likely are dealing \
		with one of the electricity sources that doesn't require flexibility \
		points, so we shouldn't curtail it. (2) We use a MAX(0) because we cannot \
		allow negative curtailment, and the curtailment function may result in \
		negative numbers for some values of FP usage between 0% and 100%. (3) If \
		the fraction of flexibility points used is between 0% and 100%, we apply \
		the curtailment function directly. However, if the FP use is over 100%, we \
		always allow a minimum amount of dispatch- the amount that would be \
		allowed by the available FP, given by the term 1-ZIDZ(1/fraction of FP \
		used). This is because the curtailment function is typically second- or \
		third-order and would result in unrealistically high curtailment at very \
		high multiples of available FP use if it were uncapped.

	~	Dmnl [0,1]
	~	This policy represents a reduction in demand for non-energy, \
		non-agriculture industrial outputs. It can be used to represent policies \
		such as (1) material-efficient building codes reducing the amount of \
		concrete or steel in buildings, (2) requirements for improved durability \
		or longevity of products, so they are replaced less often, (3) more re-use \
		of products or intensification of use, such as more car sharing instead of \
		people owning their own cars, (4) water efficiency or waste reduction, \
		etc. Since energy demand is determined elsewhere in the model (through the \
		demand sectors and energy imports/exports), this policy cannot be used on \
		energy industries (natural gas and petroleum systems, coal mining). As the \
		"chemicals" industry includes pharmaceuticals (grouped in the same ISIC \
		code), and financial impacts tend to be dominated by pharmaceuticals \
		(which are not amenable to material efficiency or re-use strategies), we \
		disallow the use of this policy on the "chemicals" industry, to avoid \
		erroneous financial impacts. We similarly disallow the use of the policy \
		on the "other industries" category because it is too highly aggregated, \
		and actual material efficiency or re-use policies would only affect \
		certain industries within that category, so financial impacts would not be \
		right if applied to "other industries" as a whole. As of 2.0.0, the policy \
		assumes demand from all purchasers (government,industry, consumers, and \
		foreign entities) is reduced proportionately to the amount of goods they \
		buy, and it does not have any implementation cost for the policy itself, \
		beyond the financial consequences of the demand reduction. A separate \
		lever handles shifting agricultural demand from animal products to \
		non-animal products, which is the main potential mechanism of demand \
		reduction for agricultural products.

		more efficient if they are built in later and later years. The properties \
		of the average natural gas plant built during the model run define the \
		properties of the "newly built" quality level for natural gas plants. This \
		may be a weighted average of different underlying technologies, like \
		combined cycle, combustion turbine, etc. This may have the effect of \
		overstating the performance of plants built early in the model run and \
		understating the performance of plants built late in the model run, but it \
		is more feasible from a model standpoint than tracking each annual cohort \
		of power plants individually (with its own set of values for each input \
		variable that defines its properties).

	~	Plug-in hybrids can shift to either electricity or biofuels. To model this \
		explicitly would be very difficult, as we'd need to account for three \
		possible shifts (petroleum gasoline to biofuel gasoline, petroleum \
		gasoline to electricity, and biofuel gasoline to electricity). In \
		practice, biofuel gasoline is hardly used by plug-in hybrids, and \
		electricity will always be the more economical choice for satisfying an \
		LCFS via generation of carbon-free energy. Therefore, we only allow for \
		one of these three types of shifts in plug-in hybrids: petroleum gasoline \
		to electricity. Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \
		assigned to those vehicles, rather than to plug-in hybrids, later in the \
		calculation steps).

	~	We use -9999 for slopes of lines approaching points that are not in the \
		future, because we are going to choose the highest slope to any future \
		point, and we don't want any slopes that are not to future points to be \
		selected. Note that we haven't built for the current model year yet in the \
		calculation flow, so the current model year counts as being in the future. \
		Also note that in order to prevent the policy case line from diverging \
		from the BAU line in years prior to the first year policies take effect \
		(which is often a year in the past), we only give electricity producers \
		foresignt to BAU RPS values in years when the additional RPS policy is not \
		in effect (thus mirroring BAU case foresight).

		supplied by the fuel supplier who is receiving this revenue. All types of \
		energy suppliers could conceivably own electric vehicles, but this \
		variable is subscripted by Transportation Fuel, and coal isn't a \
		transportation fuel, so we don't have an easy way to assign this money to \
		coal suppliers. We could build a separate structure for this, but EV \
		rebates due to ownership of EVs by these companies is an extremely tiny \
		cash flow, so it is not worth the extra complexity. Instead, we include it \
		in the same category as electricity suppliers, who are the main purchasers \

The LCFS calculation (and policy lever setting) refer only to the fuel used by regulated vehicle types (as specified by the model adapter in an input variable), after adjustment for the efficiency of use of electricity.  Hence, we calculate the various LCFS metrics here, as the ratio of carbon free energy to all energy that meets these two conditions.

We estimate start year fuel use (that is, one year before the first simulated year) by calculating it using data from the first simulated year.  This saves us the burden of calculating it in Excel and providing it as input data, and it prevents discontinuities as the model switches over from the provided value to a value calculated from the properties of the fleet.

To calibrate a vehicle type with a lifetime longer than the model run, such as rail, temporarily extend the model run by changing FINAL TIME to a farther-out value, such as 2060.  Perform the calibration, then restore FINAL TIME to its former value (2050).

Separately-regulated pollutants are non-CO2 combustion byproducts whose emissions are limited by law, such as a limit on NOx emissions per kilometer.  Improving fuel efficiency causes less fuel to be burned per kilometer, but it may not reduce emissions of NOx per kilometer.  Vehicle manufacturers design vehicles to meet fuel economy and conventional pollutant standards separately and may narrowly comply with each standard.  So, if fuel economy improves, the vehicle manufacturer may allow more NOx to be emitted per gram of gasoline burned, to keep the NOx rate per kilometer just under the standard.  We assume that separately-regulated pollutants are unaffected by changes in fuel economy, while other pollutants increase or decrease in proportion to changes in fuel economy.

If you are in a hurry and do not wish to calibrate every vehicle/cargo/tech combination, you can give all technologies (within a specific vehicle/cargo combination) the same SoCDTtiNTY value.  In this case, eliminate abrupt changes in "Retiring Vehicles Summed Across Technologies" rather than in "Retiring Vehicles."

All changes in revenue and expenditures here should be due to changes in domestic vehicles.  Changes in revenue or expenditure from selling vehicles for export is handled in the Industry sector, where vehicle suppliers are lumped into the "other industries" category.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

A "flexibility point" is a quantity of flexibility on the grid (provided by any combination of dispatchable generation, storage, and demand response) that enables the grid to support BOTH one MW of wind and one MW of solar.  We allow each flexibility point to support both generation types because wind and solar tend to be in need of support/backup at different times of the day and so can use the same flexibility resources.

The RPS ensures enough potential electricity output from RPS-qualifying sources is available.  The RPS does not explicitly affect dispatch, because the contract-based dispatch ought to take priority (and if high enough, is allowed to violate the RPS), and thereafter, the renewables ought to be dispatched first under least cost dispatch anyway, due to their low marginal cost

Policy-mandated new capacity is not subject to the build limits, but any capacity built under this policy does subtract from the amount that can be built apart from this policy (to a minimum of zero).

If all such slopes are negative (i.e. all future RPS targets are below the surviving RPS-qualifying percentage), the minimum RPS-qualifying percentage sought will drop over time, but this will not matter, as no significant amount of RPS-qualifying resources are likely to retire during the model run.

All support services (demand response, grid batteries, electric vehicles, and transmission capacity across the modeled region border) that can support the grid in one part of the modeled region may not be able to support the grid in a different part of the modeled region, subject to transmission constraints.  Hence, the available peak reduction services from all of these resources are limited by the transmission connectivity coefficient.

When determining the share of demand that can be met from surviving RPS-qualifying sources, we use the surviving sources' expected electricity output, which is based on their expected capacity factors.  We can't use their actual output this year because dispatch calculations are handled later in the calculation flow.  If the model thinks the RPS is satisfied but is not dispatching enough RPS-qualifying sources to meet the RPS, either adjust the expected capacity factors of RPS-qualifying sources, or adjust the dispatch settings (such as eliminating guaranteed dispatch for fossil plants that may crowd out RE).

Decommissioning costs for power plants are calculated (see the Electricity Supply - Cash Flow tab), but they are intentionally excluded from the calculation that determines what plant types to build, reflecting the fact that real-world utilities disregard these decades-distant, end-of-life costs when choosing what new plant types to build.

This causes retirements of technologies like coal or natural gas as the mean cost of production declines, as more renewables come onto the system.

We disallow early economic retirement of technologies whose cost is below the average in the current year, even if they are farther below the mean price in the BAU case than they are in the policy case.  (This prevents a situation where the mean declines because lots of cheap renewables go on the grid, causing cheap sources like solar or wind to retire because they are becoming less-cheap relative to the mean in the policy case than they were in the BAU case.)

If the fuel shift involves no capital cost (i.e. it's a drop-in fuel replacement, not a retrofit), we only compare the dispatch costs.  If it is a retrofit, we also check to ensure the plant type being retrofitted TO is not uneconomic, because it would be unlikely for a utility to secure financing and retrofit a plant to a type that's going to lose money (even if the loss rate is slower than the pre-retrofit loss rate).  Instead of paying for the retrofit, they'd likely build a plant type that will not lose money.

All support services (demand response, grid batteries, electric vehicles, and transmission capacity across the modeled region border) that can support the grid in one part of the modeled region may not be able to support the grid in a different part of the modeled region, subject to transmission constraints.  Hence, the available peak reduction services from all of these resources are limited by the transmission connectivity coefficient.

This page calculates changes in cash flows due to spending by the electricity sector, including on constructing new generation, buying fuel, OM, building transmission, etc.  It also calculates changes in electricity prices, for use on the "Fuels" sheet.  This sheet does not calculate cash flow impacts of changes in electricity sales, because those are handled on the cash flow pages of the various electricity-demanding sectors.

In this case, electricity suppliers are paying other electricity suppliers, so we don't recognize cash flow changes by entity.  (Broken-out industries are not restricted to the modeled region's borders.)  We do add the Change in Amount Spend on Importing Electricity to the Change in Total Outlays and Change in Capital Labor and Fuel Expenditures metrics, however.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

In order to compare the cost of running building components that serve the same buildings with the same fuel, we need to calculate a hypothetical energy use quantity in the BAU case, if the fuel shifting policy (and no other policy) had applied to that case.  Otherwise, we see large increases in cost per unit services for components using the target fuel (most commonly electricity) and large drops for other components, which is wrong, as it would be interpreting a fuel shift as fuel increases and decreases at the same service levels.

SoCEUtiNTY values for each component/building type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Buildings Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCEUtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Components Potential Energy Use Summed Across Fuels" at the years corresponding to component lifetimes.

Note that for greater accuracy, it would be necessary to know how many years early components are replaced due to retrofitting, then to subtract out the energy use of the replaced components BOTH from new and from retiring components energy use in that year, because the component isn't being replaced in that year anymore, as it was replaced earlier.  In practice, these subtractions largely cancel each other out, and it's hard to find data on the number of years early that components would be replaced, so we simplify by not including this interaction.

Since input BCEU data may not be perfectly in sync with input lifetime (CL) data, to make our calculated BAU case components energy use match the input data, we use a correction factor.  The correction factor is calculated in Vensim and should be small if your BCEU and CL data are accurate and well-aligned with each other.  Larger discrepencies between data in BCEU and CL will result in a larger correction factor.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

This includes cash flow changes to energy suppliers due to changes in their purchases of non-energy products stemming from overall changes in production of non-energy products.  This is calculated based on purchasing ISIC code, which doesn't separate out the energy suppliers, so we can't assign these cash flows to particular energy suppliers, so we leave them assigned to the correct energy industry ISIC codes.

Industries adjust the prices of their goods to reflect policy-driven changes in the amount they must pay to produce those goods (due to such things as carbon and fuel taxes (increasing costs), efficiency standards (increasing equipment costs, decreasing fuel costs), etc.  We do NOT pass through changes in expenditures due to changes in production, because an industry that spends less on buying input steel because it is producing fewer output products can't make the output products cheaper due to buying less steel.  That's already accounted for in the fact that there are fewer output products.

We annualize abatement from avoidance of large one-time carbon releases (deforestation, peat fires) over the time required for the forest or peatland to regenerate after a major carbon release.  This avoids unrealistic, spiky results and also allows the associated policies to be treated in a way consistent with other land use sector policies (except improved forest management).

We must include a one-step delay before calculating costs and fuel use to power CCS, as electricity is one of the fuels that can power CCS (in the Industry sector), and this influences electricity demand, which influences "Electricity Sector Pollutant Emissions before CCS," used here to help calculate sequestration from electric sector generation types.  (Note that Vensim incorrectly fails to generate a "Simultaneous Equation" error in the Policy (non-BAU) version of this loop, but it is actually circular in both the BAU and non-BAU structures.)

Changes in crude exports due to changes in secondary production should not be apportioned into changes in crude production or crude imports, because the crude that was formerly being used to make secondary products is now being exported instead.  Therefore, we subtract out any change in crude exports due to changes in secondary production.

This is not the cost to produce a unit of fuel.  This is the total change in costs for each fuel supplier, divided among the units of fuel that supplier produces, so that supplier can recover his/her actual costs by charging more for each unit of fuel they sell in the policy case.  This is why all changes in expenditures (including changes in expenditures due to changes in production) are included here and are divided only by the policy case fuel production, without using the BAU case fuel production.

For each fuel, BAU in-region consumption should equal BAU production plus BAU imports minus BAU exports.  BAU consumption data is summed from the various sectors, which have the data with high granularity particular to each sector.  We ensure the equation holds by calculating one of the three other terms (production, imports, or exports), with the term to be calculated specified by input data (since this can vary by fuel and by modeled region).

Revenue for fuel, equipment, or labor provided to the modeled region's sectors (transportation, electricity, buildings, industry, district heat, hydrogen, etc.) is not export revenue, as the sectors represent activitiy within the modeled region.  Changes in export revenue in the EPS only come from the industry sector (where more or fewer non-energy goods can be sold to foreign entities) and in the fuels sector (where more or fewer fuels and electricity can be exported).

This section calculates the change of revenue for fuel-supplying entities attributable to each fuel type they produce.  This is done to allocate revenue changes for fuel suppliers to ISIC codes in the I/O model, as the ISIC codes don't map neatly onto the cash flow entities (but can be mapped neatly onto the fuel types).

"Requirements" variables refer to the number of jobs, amount of added value, or earnings in each industry that is required to produce a particular level of output by a particular industry.  If you have a known change in output level of a particular industry (e.g. caused by policy, elsewhere in the EPS), you can multiply this by a requirements variable to determine how many jobs, added value, or earnings were required (created) in order to provide that incremental output.

Here, we account for the economic activity generated by changes in spending by government and by households (labor and consumers).  If we had domestic policies that influenced foreign spending on domestically-produced, non-fuel industrial goods, that change in spending would need to be factored in here also.  (Changes in fuel exports are already accounted for in change in domestic fuel production.)

The Domestic Leontief Inverse Matrix filters out spending spent on foreign goods/services insofar as respending and cash flows between ISIC codes.  It expects an input that is the direct change in output for domestic ISIC codes (that is, it won't reduce the direct changes in output it receives to eliminate a foreign share), so we must do that as a separate step here.  (Conversely, a "Total" or "Global" Leontief Inverse Matrix does not filter respending flows and requires a total (not just domestic) change in output as its input.)

We are calculating the impacts on suppliers of the industries that are boosted by the policies, so the boosted industry is the target industry, and the indirect or induced impacts are on each source (supplier) industry.  This is why each industry here (and in "Induced Effects" below) is subscripted by "Source ISIC Code" rather than "Target ISIC Code".

Even the fuel industries need the foreign share of revenue taken out here.

Expenses passed through to buyers (such as raising the price of a good by the amount of a tax levied on that good) don't increase output for employment (or employee compensation) purposes.  You don't need more workers because you're not making more products.  Therefore, we remove industry's revenue from passthrough costs from industry's contribution to output.  (For calculation of value added, we will add the passthrough costs back in later, because taxes and employee compensation paid are a part of value added and contribute to GDP.)

When calculating value added, we add back in industry's added revenue from passthrough expenses (which was removed earlier), because this revenue does contribute to value added (but not to employment or employee compensation).

This section calculates the domestic content share of purchases directly caused by the policy package and induced spending as a result of the policy package (e.g. household savings, government tax revenues).  Indirect spending caused by the policy package, i.e. companies buying more raw materials or parts from suppliers, is handled via DLIM and TLIM below.

The EPS only calculates the policy-induced change in *domestic* jobs, GDP, and EE compensation, not *global* jobs, GDP, or EE compensation.  Since each industry's inputs (such as raw steel) are the output of some other industry, the "Buy In-Region Outputs" policy requires domestic industries to get more of their total inputs from domestic suppliers, which we can model by scaling between DLIM and TLIM.  At 100% implementation, an industry utilizes domestic suppliers for its total input needs, so it uses TLIM values to calculate domestic job, GDP, and EE compensation impacts.

These government and household spending variables are only used to determine the proportion of spending going to each ISIC code.  Therefore, the time series projection here is meant simply to reflect how growth or shrinkage of one ISIC code relative to another is reflected in (in reality, partially caused by) changes in government and household spending.  It does not matter whether these variables contain accurate absolute amounts spent, as they are not used for that purpose.

There is no way to use projected output by ISIC code to obtain projected DLIM or TLIM variables.  In general, even if an industry gets larger or smaller in the future, it may need the same sorts of inputs (from its own and from other ISIC codes) to produce a unit of output.  These requirements can shift over time - for instance, an industry that today requires metal might someday require less metal but more plastic.  However, we can't get these sorts of shifts in what inputs industries need and on what they spend their money from changes in total output by that industry, or by other industries.  Therefore, we do not attempt to make time-series DLIM or TLIM variables.

We assume that changes in output for each specific ISIC code are directly proportional to changes in employment, value added, and total employee compensation paid by that ISIC code.  Note that economy-wide shifts in these three metrics (not arising from growth or shrinkage of various ISIC codes, such as a tendency across all industries to pay workers more per hour worked) can be implemented through BPEaCP.  (See the "Time Series Totals" section later on this sheet.)

BAU Employment, Value Added, and Employee Compensation by ISIC Code by Year are already time-series values and don't necessarily need modification.  However, they were obtained by scaling these three things by changes in BAU Output.  On the upside, this captures the growth and shrinkage of one industry relative to another, and if an industry with (say) a higher labor intensity becomes bigger, then we will correctly see jobs increase faster than value added.  But it doesn't capture economy-wide effects that shift the balance of these three variables, such as (for example) a trend across all industries to pay workers more money per year per worker.  Therefore, we leave in place the BPEaCP variable, to allow model developers to implement economy-wide shifts in employment, value added, and EE compensation on top of the shifts caused by the growth and shrinkage of specific ISIC codes.

In the demand sectors' energy demand feedback loops, we want to feed back in only the percent change in demand caused by the indirect and induced effects of the policy package (as the direct effects are already included in each of these sectors).  The exception is the "Buy In-Region" policy lever, whose direct effects are not included in each sector (as the first place that policy influences the calculation flow is in the I/O model).  Therefore, its direct impacts need to be added to the macroeconomic feedback loops to capture associated energy use and emissions.  (The indirect and induced effects of the Buy In-Region policy are already part of the total indirect and induced effects, so they are already included in the macroeconomic feedback loops.)

We did not reassign any share of the change in industries' output (revenue) to government (for taxes) or to labor and consumers (for workforce payments) in front of the IO model.  Therefore, we need to use the full impacts of the change in output on government and labor cash flow (as calculated by the IO model) to feed into the IO model in the next timestep.  That is, we don't want to limit the change in ouptut used here to indirect effects.

Exception: the change in fuel industry revenue was already reduced by the change in taxes on fuels, and the resulting change in tax revenue was already assigned to government.

The change in output by industry is the source of these macro outputs.  We don't want to feed back the residual change in industry output into the IO model, because that would be double-counting this industry change in revenue.  We only want the macro changes in government and household cash flows to feed back in.

It is okay that direct changes in government or household cash flow create further changes via this feedback.  For instance, imagine a policy that increases household income (suppose, via a tax cut funded by deficit spending).  Households buy more goods, which leads to more employment and employee compensation, which further increases household cash flow and spending.

In the IO model, indirect impact on value added includes passthrough expenses, because taxes and employee compensation contribute to GDP.  However, a tax that is passed through doesn't increase output, so it should not affect value added when it is used in a feedback loop that adjusts energy service demand.  Therefore, we calculate a special version of indirect impacts on value added here that excludes passthrough costs.

In other words, this feedback is the replacement for partitioning out the government and labor portions of cash flows for industries ahead of the I/O model (which we do not do).  Industry already had its portion fed through the I/O model, but government and labor have not, hence the feedback.

Carbon taxes are levied upstream on fuel sales, before it is known whether a unit of fuel will be burned with or without CCS.  So the government must pay CCS providers back for the tax they already paid (capitalized into the cost of their fuels).  Also, CCS providers might sell their CCS services on a market for credits.  So carbon tax rebates are distinct rebate payments (which we classify as subsidies), not a reduction in tax.

Taxes on fuel, equipment, and O&M expenses are already included in these totals.  The carbon tax on process emissions needs to be added separately, as it is also part of OpEx.

Any tax revenue that is rebated to households or businesses (i.e. partial or total revenue neutrality) doesn't count toward the Total Change in CapEx and OpEx metric, so we subtract out any tax rebate payments here.

Changes in purchases of non-energy input materials (e.g. raw steel, etc.) are also a part of OpEx, but at present, we don't separate out input materials from other industrial products - we only have the total change in expenditures on all industrial products in variable "Changes in Nonenergy Expenditures by Entity due to Production Changes."  Including this entire variable in the cost metric tends to overwhelm other components of the cost metric when material efficiency policies are enabled.  For now, we exclude changes in spending on input materials from the CapEx + OpEx metric.  We may revisit this in a future EPS update.

Energy-related emissions are all anthropogenic emissions from within the borders of the modeled region except industrial process emissions and anthropogenic LULUCF emissions.  Energy-related emissions captured by CCS do not count as emissions (i.e. we only include net energy-related emissions here).  However, emissions from fuel burned in the geoengineering sector are energy-related emissions, but CO2 captured from the atmosphere (DAC) does not count as negative energy-related emissions.

Whether or not policies are ENABLED, all changes in revenues and expenditures for non-energy industries should be identical to those values when divided by ISIC Code.  Up to about +/- $1 million variance (maybe more with some policy packages) is to be expected due to limitations on accuracy of floating point calculations in Vensim.
